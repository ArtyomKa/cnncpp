## Tasks

[ ] Layers:
    [ ] - Convolution 2D
        [x] Implement Convolutions
        [ ] Support fot stride > 1
        [ ] Add activation and bias
    [x] - Avg Pooling
    [x] - Max Pooling
    [ ] - Fully COnnected
[x] Find (and train) a reference implementation of MNIST
    [ ] - Find a way to export weights and load them into cnncpp
[ ] Contruct and run the network (LeNet Arch)
