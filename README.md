## Tasks

- [ ] Layers:
    * [ ]  Convolution 2D
        - [x] Implement Convolutions
        - [x] Support for stride > 1
        - [ ] Add activation and bias
    * [ ] Flatten
    * [x] - Avg Pooling
    * [x] - Max Pooling
    * [x] - Fully Connected
- [x] Find (and train) a reference implementation of MNIST
    * [ ] - Find a way to export weights and load them into cnncpp
- [ ] Contruct and run the network (LeNet Arch)
